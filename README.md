# AHK-LinkManager
AutoHotkey based mini Tool to manage frequently used paths, URLs, files or programmes.

To jump to a desired path or open a file, you have just to invoke the context menu by pressing your shortcut (which is Windows + middle mouse button  by default) and select the particular entry. This LinkManager comes with a GUI to edit your links and setup the context menu.
The following picture shows configuration dialogue, the subsequent picture shows the context menu which is generated acordingly.
